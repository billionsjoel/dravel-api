# DRAVEL APP

The project you are going to build for the Final Capstone Project is based on an app to book an appointment to try a motorcycle. You should follow the given design of the website, but you must personalize the content, i.e., instead of booking an appointment to try a motorcycle, you can build an app to book an appointment with a doctor, or reserve an online class with a teacher. This is highly encouraged since having unique projects in your portfolio will help you stand out while looking for jobs.
